One day, my friend invited @hogehogebomber to this channel after the match.
Of course, that's who we played League of Laplace together and banned by cheating.
@poopbOObbeep said "he joined to this team to destroy that fucking game maker."
How big plan is it? Well, I bet some chips. ...of potato.
But @justOnlyJustice seems to dislike the wanted person enough to leave this channel.
I guess what I should do is ...this. *This teams has broken up*
